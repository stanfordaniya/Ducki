# 🦆 Ducki by Aniya Stanford

## 📖 Description
Ducki was a fully featured Apple Watch companion app that brought a customizable virtual pet duck to your wrist.  
It combined tamagotchi-style care, multiple mini-games, and a virtual economy, all optimized for quick, fun interactions.  

While the app was feature-complete, it was ultimately discontinued and is no longer being maintained.  
This repository serves as an archive of the project for reference and portfolio purposes.
